Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain. They automatically perform actions when specific conditions are met.

In the blockchain-based bidding system, smart contracts manage the auction process. They record bids, keep track of the highest bid, and ensure that the auction rules are followed.

Once the auction deadline is reached, the smart contract automatically selects the highest bidder as the winner. It then securely transfers ownership of the digital asset and processes the payment.

Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they cannot be changed after deployment. This guarantees that the auction rules cannot be manipulated by anyone, including the platform owners.

Smart contracts remove the need for trust between users because the code itself enforces fairness and transparency.
