The Blockchain-Based Bidding System is a decentralized platform where users can participate in secure and transparent auctions.

There are two main types of users: sellers and bidders. Sellers upload items or NFTs for auction, while bidders place bids on those items. Every bid is recorded on the blockchain through smart contracts.

The system prevents bid manipulation because once a bid is placed, it cannot be changed or deleted. All participants can trust that the auction process is fair.

When the auction time ends, the smart contract automatically determines the highest bidder and finalizes the transaction. This removes the need for a middleman and reduces the risk of fraud.

The chatbot in this system helps users understand how the platform works, how bidding happens, and how blockchain ensures security and fairness.
