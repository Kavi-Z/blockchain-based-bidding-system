System Architecture Overview

Frontend Layer
The frontend is a web-based interface that allows users to view auctions, place bids, and interact with the system.

Backend Layer
The backend handles user authentication, auction management, and communication with blockchain services.

Blockchain Layer
Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain manage auctions, bids, and winner selection in a decentralized manner.

AI Services Layer
The AI service provides intelligent question-answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Vector Database
Textual knowledge is stored as embeddings in a vector database to enable semantic search.

Data Flow
User queries are processed by the backend and routed to the AI service, which retrieves relevant documents and generates responses.

Security Layer
Authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication ensure system security.

Scalability
The system is designed to scale horizontally by separating frontend, backend, blockchain, and AI services.
