Auction Rules and Regulations

Auction Type
The system supports time-based online auctions. Each auction has a fixed start time and end time.

Bid Eligibility
Only registered and verified users are allowed to place bids. Users must be logged in to participate in an auction.

Minimum Bid Increment
Each new bid must be higher than the current highest bid by at least the minimum increment defined by the auction creator.

Bid Validity
A bid is considered valid only if it is successfully recorded on the blockchain. Failed or reverted transactions are ignored.

Auction Closing
Once the auction end time is reached, no further bids are accepted. The highest valid bid at closing time is declared the winner.

Winner Declaration
The winning bidder is automatically selected by the smart contract and announced through the system interface.

Bid Cancellation
Bids cannot be withdrawn once submitted and confirmed on the blockchain.

Fraud Prevention
All bids are immutable and transparent, preventing bid manipulation or tampering.

Dispute Resolution
In case of disputes, the blockchain transaction records serve as the final source of truth.
