Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored across a network of computers.
It is immutable, transparent, and decentralized, which ensures trust and security without relying on a central authority.

Key features:
- Blocks: Each block contains a list of transactions and a hash linking it to the previous block.
- Consensus: Nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions.
- Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts that automate processes.
- Security: Cryptography ensures data integrity and prevents tampering.

Applications:
- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Supply chain tracking
- Voting systems
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Digital identity
