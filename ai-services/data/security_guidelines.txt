Security Guidelines

User Authentication
Strong passwords and secure authentication mechanisms are enforced.

Wallet Security
Users should never share private keys or recovery phrases.

Smart Contract Security
Smart contracts are audited to prevent vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks.

Data Integrity
Blockchain immutability ensures bids cannot be altered once confirmed.

Environment Variables
Sensitive keys and credentials must be stored in environment variables, not source code.

Access Control
Only authorized users and services can access critical system components.

Monitoring
The system continuously monitors for suspicious activities and anomalies.

Backup and Recovery
Critical data and configurations are backed up regularly to ensure recovery in case of failures.
